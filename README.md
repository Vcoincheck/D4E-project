## ⚡ Getting Started
# 🌐 D4E Project

A modular DAO management platform built with React and TypeScript. The project uses an AppShell layout, dynamic routing, and reusable UI primitives (based on shadcn/ui).

## Overview

- Modular architecture: clear separation between layout, pages and features
- AppShell with shared sidebar, topbar and footer
- Reusable UI components under `src/components` and `src/ui`
- Global providers for theme and localization
- WalletConnect integration, DAO creation wizards, proposal flows and governance tools

## Project structure (short)

src/
	├─ app.tsx / main.tsx       # entry point, router and AppShell
	├─ components/             # shared components (DAO, Proposal, etc.)
	├─ providers/              # Theme, Language, Wallet providers
	├─ ui/                     # shadcn-based UI primitives
	├─ styles/                 # CSS / Tailwind globals
	└─ assets/                 # images, logos, icons

The repository contains more detailed folders such as `src/components/dao`, `src/components/proposals`, etc.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or pnpm
- (Optional) Docker / VS Code Dev Container

## Development — install & run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/D4E-project.git
cd D4E-project
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or: pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# Vite usually starts at http://localhost:5173
```

## Build & preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Important scripts

- npm run dev — start the dev server
- npm run build — build for production
- npm run preview — preview the production build
- npm run lint — run ESLint checks

## Development notes

- Features are organized in modules; each module typically contains `components/`, `steps/`, and `hooks/`.
- Global providers (Theme, Language, Wallet) are initialized in `src/providers` or `src/app`.
- This README only documents how to run and navigate the project — source code was not modified.

## Contributing

- Open an issue to discuss larger changes.
- Create a branch for your work, include a description and tests when applicable, and open a PR against `main`.

## License

See the `LICENSE` file in the repository for license details.
