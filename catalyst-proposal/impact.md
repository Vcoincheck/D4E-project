# Impact

### Impact & Benefit

#### **1. Real-world adoption of Cardano DAOs**

* By designing DAO templates suited for small businesses, NGOs, and startups, we make Cardano governance applicable outside of Web3-native environments.
* This expands the use of Cardano's tech stack into the enterprise sector and promotes adoption among non-technical users.

#### **2. Strong UX = Higher participation**

* A clean, structured user interface (Prototype → MVP) removes the complexity of DAO creation, proposal management, and on-chain voting.
* This lowers the barrier to entry for new users, improving proposal quality and increasing voter turnout across the ecosystem.

#### **3. Discoverability through DAO Hub**

* The DAO Hub helps the community explore active DAOs, see ongoing governance activities, and access voting history—all in one place.
* This increases visibility for DAOs, encourages best-practice learning, and fosters transparency.

#### **4. Extensibility for developers**

* MVP components (modular UI, DAO metadata schema, reusable smart contracts) are built to be **open-source** and reusable by other dApp builders.
* This encourages a network effect: teams can fork, extend, or integrate our code into their own DAO tooling on Cardano.

#### **5. Catalyst alignment and long-term sustainability**

* The project directly aligns with the Catalyst mission of advancing decentralized governance and open participation.
* Our testnet MVP is designed for public feedback and will inform future iterations toward a mainnet launch, supported by additional community funding or B2B use cases.
