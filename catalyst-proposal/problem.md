# Problem

#### **1. DAO fragmentation on Cardano**

* There is currently no centralized portal to discover and track Cardano-based DAOs in one place.
* Community members often rely on social media, Discord, or word-of-mouth to find DAO activity, which is inefficient and discourages participation.

#### **2. Lack of native DAO tools tailored for Cardano**

* Most DAO tools are designed for EVM-based chains and do not support Cardano-specific features like extended UTxO, native scripts, or datum-driven smart contracts.
* Builders are forced to either heavily customize external frameworks or build from scratch, increasing development cost and time.

#### **3. Poor user experience & high technical barrier**

* Setting up a DAO on Cardano currently requires deep knowledge of wallet integration, off-chain logic, and on-chain script constraints.
* Thereâ€™s no user-friendly platform offering guided UI/UX to define DAO types, voting mechanisms, treasury rules, or member roles.

#### **4. Missing testnet-friendly framework for DAO innovation**

* Builders and governance researchers lack a modular, pluggable framework to prototype and test governance ideas safely on testnet eviroment.
* Without such a framework, experimenting with concepts like quadratic voting, time-locked voting, or hybrid on/off-chain models is cumbersome and error-prone.
