Tip

* Its is important to ensure that you're in sole control of your wallet keys, and that the keys used can be restored via alternate wallet providers if a particular one is non-functional. Hence, put extra attention to `Non-Custodial` and `Compatibility` fields.
* The score column below is strictly a count of checks against each feature listed, the impact of specific feature (and thus, score) is up to reader's descretion.
* The table represents current state on mainnet network, any future roadmap activities are out-of-scope.
* Info on individual fields can be found towards the end of the page.
* Any field that shows partial support (eg: open-source field) does not score the point for that field.
* New additions are welcome, please click edit link and submit PRs if any of the below is found to be outdated or if a new wallet support is to be added.
